* See it in action!

The sample creates several organization charts and shows options available in the 
C1OrgChart control, including horizontal and vertical alignment as well as the use 
of template selectors.


* Collapse and Expand

Demonstrates binding elements to properties of the C1OrgChart to create collapsible nodes


* Template Selector

Demonstrates how to select templates for each item when data binding.

The DataTemplateSelector class allows you to select different templates based on features 
of specific data items. For example, you could use different templates to display directors, 
managers, and clerical staff.


* HierarchicalDataTemplate

Demonstrates advanced binding scenarios using the DataTemplateSelector and
HierarchicalDataTemplate classes.

The HierarchicalDataTemplate class allows you to bind the C1OrgChart control to items that 
contain items of different types. For example, you could create a chart that displays 
leagues, divisions within each league, and teams within each division.
