#### Shows how to add custom localizable resources for C1 UWP controls.
____
This application shows the same features as SchedulerSamples application. But it uses Russian culture and 2 customized Russian translations.
To include custom translation for resources defined in C1 UPW assemblies, you should do the next:

* find default localization resources shipped with controls in the Help\LocalizationResources.zip file;
* copy file which you want to localize to your application folder and include it into application;
* don't change file name, only make sure you added correct languege suffix, for example, lang-ru, before resw extension;
* edit file;
* change application default language to desired culture.
