The application consists of 3 pages:

1) The Home page highlights new features included into the current release 
and shows active tiles for favorite features.

2) The Control List page shows active tiles for all UWP controls. 

3) The Sample page shows the tree of available samples for the selected control 
and shows the sample for the currently selected tree node.

Points of interest:

1) The project is driven by an Xml resource file that lists the controls that should
be exposed by the sample.
