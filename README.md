# ComponentOne UWP Edition Samples 

A complete suite of 60+ UI controls for the Universal Windows Platform.

This repository contains the samples for [ComponentOne UWP Edition](https://developer.mescius.com/componentone/uwp-ui-controls). These samples provide complete implementation details for the UWP control features. They are also included with the full download and install from developer.mescius.com/componentone. 

The samples reference, but do not include, the control packages. The control packages can be downloaded from nuget.org.

## Building a Sample 

.NET Framework samples require VS2012 and above. .NET Core samples will require VS2017 and above. You can also build any .NET Core sample using the .NET Core CLI, which is installed with the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). 

Then run these commands from the CLI in the directory of any sample: 

```
dotnet build 
dotnet run 
```
This will install any needed dependencies, build the project, and run the project respectively.
