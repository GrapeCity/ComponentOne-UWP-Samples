Each tile has three states:

1) Default state: all tiles are the same size and show medium amount of details.
2) Maximized state: One tile is maximized to show maximum amount of details.
3) Minimized state: When one tile is maximized, all other tiles are minimized showing minimum amount of details.

Maximize a tile by tapping its header. Tapping the header again will switch to default state.

Reorder tiles by dragging tile headers.
