A former top-ranking soprano in New York, Hathaway was reportedly a front-runner for the role of &quot;Christine&quot; in the 2004 The Phantom of the Opera (2004). However, due to scheduling conflicts with The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she couldn&apos;t take the role, which was later given to newcomer Emmy Rossum.Hathaway soon started to move away from family-friendly films. Following The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement (2004), she appeared topless in the films Havoc (2005) opposite Josh Peck and Brokeback Mountain (2005) opposite Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Her desire to break out of her &quot;Princess Diaries&quot; image parallels that of her one-time co-star, Julie Andrews, who went topless in the film S.O.B. (1981) in order to break away from the image she created from her 1960s musicals. In interviews, Hathaway said that doing family-friendly films didn&apos;t mean she was similar to their characters or mean she objected to appearing nude in other films.</Description>

<Name>Carice van Houten</Name>
<Description>Carice Anouk van Houten was born in Leiderdorp (near Leiden) on 5 September 1976. Her parents are Margje Stasse, who is on the board of Dutch educational TV, and writer and broadcaster Theodore van Houten. She is the elder sister of actress and designer Jelka van Houten. Her paternal grandmother was Scottish. When she was five, her father took her to a screening of Abel Gance&apos;s epic Napol√©on vu par Abel Gance (1927), which fascinated her. She has demonstrated great interest in cinema since. Carice convincingly demonstrated her acting talents at the Bonifatius Lyceum high school, &quot;Utrecht&quot;, in the early 90s. One of her first parts was the title role in Hugo Claus&apos; play, &quot;Tijl Uilenspiegehel&quot;. She also developed a skill in clarinet playing. In 1995, she was rather uniquely accepted by both the Maastricht and Amsterdam drama academies, and started her TV career (Labyrint, VPRO TV 1997) as a student of the Kleinkunst Academie Amsterdam. There, she was awarded the 1999 Pisuisse Prize, and the 2000 Top Naeff Prize for her theatre work. A day before the Top Naeff Prize, she was awarded the &apos;Gouden Kalf&apos; as best TV actress in Martin Koolhoven&apos;s Suzy Q (1999). In 2001, she starred in AmnesiA (2001), by the same director. In September 2000, she joined the Noord-Nederlands Toneel, starring as a both singing and acting &quot;Polly&quot; in a contemporary staging of the Threepenny Opera to fabulously stunning reviews. Her great talent for dark comedy was demonstrated in a parody on City Lights (1931)&apos; blind girl in the Amsterdam Kleine Komedie. Carice is a great admirer of American silent comedies - particularly Charles Chaplin and Laurel &amp; Hardy - although she can display an equally dramatic talent. In 2001, she made Minoes (2001), in the title role of the cat-woman after Annie M.G. Schmidt. In the 2001-02 season, she won the main role in a theatre production of Schmidt&apos;s musical, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;.Van Houten&apos;s role in Zwartboek (2006) launched her international career. She went on to play in films such as Valkyrie (2008), alongside Tom Cruise, who asked for her to specifically play his wife after seeing her performance in &quot;Zwartboek&quot;. However, after this, her international career was unsuccessful, until she was offered the role of &quot;Melisandre&quot; in the HBO series, Game of Thrones (2011), in 2011.</Description>

<Name>Chris Evans</Name>
<Description>On the advice of friends, he landed an internship at a casting office and befriended a couple of the agents he regularly communicated with - one of whom later took him on as a client. The screen - not the stage - then became his focus; Evans soon began auditioning for feature films and series television. Evans made one of his first appearances on The Fugitive (2000) (CBS, 2000-2001), a remake of the 1960s series and feature film starring Harrison Ford. In the episode &quot;Guilt&quot;, Evans played the son of a small-town sheriff who tries to exact revenge after Dr. Kimble - incognito as a liquor store owner - refuses to sell him and his friends alcohol. After small roles in Cherry Falls (2000) and The Newcomers (2000) - two unknown low-budget features - Evans appeared in Boston Public (2000) (Fox, 2000-2004) as a murder suspect. He then appeared in his first major feature, Not Another Teen Movie (2001), a spoof on teen comedies wherein he played a jock who makes a bet that he can turn an unpopular and unkempt girl (Chyler Leigh) into prom queen.After filming a couple of television pilots he was confident would be successful - Just Married (2003) and Eastwick (2002) - he appeared in another listless teen comedy, The Perfect Score (2004), playing an average, ho-hum student who takes part in a plot to steal the SAT test. Hijinks naturally ensue. Then, Evans broke through to the Big Time, grabbing the lead in the kidnapping thriller, Cellular (2004), a suspenseful B movie with a cheesy gimmick - a random wrong number on his cell phone forces him into a high-stakes race to save an unknown woman&apos;s life. Despite an unassuming performance from Evans and Kim Basinger as the damsel in distress, Cellular (2004) failed to break any box office records or please a wide majority of critics. Evans then prepared himself for super stardom when he signed on to play &quot;Johnny Storm&quot; (a.k.a. The Human Torch)in Fantastic Four (2005), 20th Century Fox&apos;s long-awaited adaptation of the Marvel comic. Although the film was wildly uneven and disappointing, Evans nearly stole the show with his energetic, unfettered performance. In that year itself, Chris was noticed by critics and made it into magazine and Internet countdowns, scoring himself a third position of the hot body countdown from Gay.com and #18 on E! Television&apos;s 2006 101 Sexiest Celebrity Bodies.The year 2007 also proved to be one successful year for Chris, as he had two movies released around the world that same year, starting with the second installment of the Marvel franchise Fantastic Four. Chris received positive reviews for his performance. The Nanny Diaries (2007), where Evans played &quot;Harvard Hottie&quot;, showed his sensitive. The year 2008 saw Chris Evans part of the movie Street Kings (2008), playing the character &quot;Detective Paul Diskant&quot;. Street Kings is a movie about police officers trying to cover up their wrongdoings and audiences got to see a serious side of Chris. In the same year, Chris also worked on the movie The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond (2008).</Description>

<Description>Helena Bonham Carter is an actress of great versatility, one of the UK&apos;s finest and most successful.In the late 1990s, Bonham Carter embarked on the next phase of her career, moving from capable actress to compelling star. Audiences and critics had long been enchanted by her delicate beauty, evocative of another time and place. Her late &apos;90s and early and mid 2000s roles included Mick Jackson&apos;s Live from Baghdad (2002), alongside Michael Keaton, receiving a nomination for both an Emmy and a Golden Globe; Paul Greengrass&apos; The Theory of Flight (1998), in which she played a victim of motor neurone disease; Trevor Nunn&apos;s Twelfth Night or What You Will (1996), in which she played Olivia; opposite Woody Allen in his Mighty Aphrodite (1995); Mort Ransen&apos;s Margaret&apos;s Museum (1995); Kenneth Branagh&apos;s Mary Shelley&apos;s Frankenstein (1994); and Franco Zeffirelli&apos;s Hamlet (1990).Other notable credits include her appearance with Steve Martin in Novocaine (2001), Tim Burton&apos;s remake of Planet of the Apes, in which she played an ape, Thaddeus O&apos;Sullivan&apos;s The Heart of Me (2002), opposite Paul Bettany, and Big Fish (2003), her second effort with Tim Burton, in which she appeared as a witch.In between her films, Helena has managed a few television appearances, which include her portrayal of Jacqui Jackson in Magnificent 7 (2005), the tale of a mother struggling to raise seven children - three daughters and four autistic boys; as Anne Boleyn in the two parter biopic of Henry VIII starring Ray Winstone; and as Morgan Le Fey, alongside Sam Neill and Miranda Richardson, in Merlin. Earlier television appearances include Michael Mann&apos;s Miami Vice (1984) as Don Johnson&apos;s junkie fianc√©e, and as a stripper who wins Rik Mayall&apos;s heart in Dancing Queen (1993). Helena has also appeared on stage, in productions of Trelawney of the Wells, The Barber of Seville, House of Bernarda Alba, The Chalk Garden, and Woman in White.Bonham Carter was nominated for a Golden Globe for the fifth time for her role in partner Tim Burton&apos;s film adaptation of the Stephen Sondheim musical, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (2007), for which Burton and co-star Johnny Depp were also nominated. For the role, she was awarded Best Actress at the Evening Standard British Film Awards 2008. Other 2000s work includes playing Mrs Bucket in Tim Burton&apos;s massive hit Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), providing the voices for the aristocratic Lady Campanula Tottington in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005) and for the eponymous dead heroine in Tim Burton&apos;s spooky Corpse Bride (2005), and co-starring in Conversations with Other Women (2005) opposite Aaron Eckhart.Since their meeting while filming Planet of the Apes (2001), Bonham Carter and Tim Burton have made seven movies together. They live in adjoining residences in London, sharing a connecting hallway, and have two children: Billy Ray Burton, 4, and Nell Burton, who was born December 15, 2007. Ironically, a mutual love of Sweeney Todd was part of the initial attraction for the pair. Despite that, Bonham Carter has said in numerous interviews that her audition process for the role of Mrs. Lovett was the most grueling of her career and that, ultimately, it was Sondheim who she had to convince that she was right for the role.</Description>

<Name>James Denton</Name>
<Description>The second of three children born to a dentist and his wife in Nashville, Tennessee, Denton grew up in Goodlettsville, Tennessee, attended Goodlettsville High School, briefly played basketball at a junior college, then went on to graduate with honors from the (national champion) University of Tennessee at Knoxville, snagging a degree in advertising as a television/journalism major on the way out the door. Even though his father was involved in community theater, Jamie didn&apos;t jump in until he was 23, during the Tennessee bicentennial in Nashville, Tennessee. His role as &quot;George Gibbs&quot; in a production of &quot;Our Town&quot; turned out to be only the first in a long line of plays that he would do, first in Nashville and then, later, in North Carolina, Chicago and California. Although he spent the next four years selling advertising for two radio stations and then for the CBS affiliate in Nashville, Jamie&apos;s heart was already in another place and, after a short stint in North Carolina, he headed to Chicago to try his hand at acting full-time. In Chicago, his first role was as &quot;Stanley&quot; in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and his last was as the terrorist &quot;Bebert&quot; in the French farce &quot;Lapin Lapin&quot;. In the years that came between the two, JD was a company member at The Griffin Theater and at Strawdog Theater Ensemble. He added a steady string of roles and accolades to his quickly growing list of achievements, including one of the leads in the world premiere of &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;, performing in and composing the music for &quot;the Night Hank Williams Died&quot;, and his portrayal of Kentucky preacher &quot;C.C. Showers&quot; in &quot;The Diviners&quot; - which gained him a much coveted nomination for a Best Actor Joseph Jefferson Award (Chicago&apos;s only theater award). A small part in The Untouchables (1993) (the series, not the movie), JAG (1995), Sliders (1995) and Dark Skies (1996). A spot on Moloney (1996), a pilot for ABC called &quot;L.A. Med&quot; and a stint on the silver screen in That Old Feeling (1997), were preludes to his first appearance as &quot;Mr. Lyle&quot; on The Pretender (1996). Immediately afterward, JD made another pilot, this time for his own series, &quot;The Hanleys&quot;. When ABC shelved the sitcom at the last minute, Denton continued producing chilling portrayals as &quot;Mr. Lyle&quot; on NBC&apos;s The Pretender (1996), as a series regular. Summer of 1999 found Jamie heading back to the theater, starring in the world premiere of the play, &quot;In Walked Monk&quot;. During the 4th season of The Pretender (1996), Jamie added three more guest-starring roles to his credits - the first on Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza Place (1998), another on Ally McBeal (1997) and the last on the hugely popular The West Wing (1999). That summer, he co-starred in &quot;Asylum&quot;, at The Court Theatre and, at the end of the year, headed for Canada to film two MOWs for TNT - The Pretender 2001 (2001) and The Pretender: Island of the Haunted (2001). 2001 found Jamie back at ABC after Steven Bochco cast him as &quot;Judge Augustus &quot;Jack&quot; Ripley&quot;, in his struggling new series, Philly (2001). Viewers liked &quot;Judge Ripley&quot; and hopes were high that the sizzling on-screen chemistry between Jamie&apos;s character and the one portrayed by Kim Delaney would convince ABC to give the show another season to improve its ratings. Ironically, Jamie was in Australia, promoting Philly (2001), when he received word that ABC had passed on renewing the show for a second season. Jamie ended 2002 with a two-part guest-starring role on The Drew Carey Show (1995). Jamie returned as a guest star on JAG (1995) in 2003, and pilot season landed him the opportunity to once again head up the cast of an ABC series in Threat Matrix (2003), a Touchstone production offering up fictionalized events relating to terrorist activity around the world. Jamie played &quot;John Kilmer&quot;, the man who lead the ultra-covert team of anti-terrorist specialists and who answered solely to the President of the United States. The timely and serious role also gave Jamie the opportunity to change his professional billing from &quot;Jamie Denton&quot; to &quot;James Denton&quot;. Only days before the annual up-fronts in New York, where the major networks announce their new fall season line-ups, ABC picked up the show for September, 2003. Although Threat Matrix (2003) held its own in one of the worst time-slots of the season (sandwiched between the hugely popular &quot;Survivor&quot; and the last season of Friends (1994)), ABC nonetheless pulled the series after only fourteen episodes aired (sixteen episodes were filmed). Threat Matrix (2003) was officially canceled on the same day as Jamie&apos;s role as &quot;Mike Delfino&quot; on Desperate Housewives (2004), a new ABC series scheduled for the Fall, was announced at the 2004 up-fronts in New York. On October 3, 2004, Desperate Housewives (2004) garnered incredible ratings with its debut episode and ABC picked up the rest of the first season before the end of the month. Less than three months later, Jamie was included in People Magazine&apos;s 2004 &quot;Sexiest Men Alive&quot; issue. During the first and second seasons of Desperate Housewives (2004), Jamie managed to schedule a sweeps week guest star spot on Reba (2001) and, toward the end of the second season, played the role of &quot;Brother John Brown&quot; in Ascension Day (2007). Years after composing the music for and performing in &quot;The Night Hank Williams Died&quot; - a play from his days in Chicago - Jamie accepted an invitation that was proffered to him by Greg Grunberg (Heroes (2006)) and became a singer and guitar player for a band that was first known as &quot;16:9&quot; and then, later, as &quot;The Band From TV&quot;. Other members of the band include, and have included, (the founder and drummer)Greg Grunberg, Hugh Laurie (keyboards, House M.D. (2004)), &apos;Bonnie Somerville&apos; (singer, Cashmere Mafia (2008)) and Bob Guiney (singer, Bachelor #4 on The Bachelor (2002)). The band largely plays at Hollywood events but does, on occasion, play elsewhere. The band donates any money that it makes to charities that are selected by each of its primary members. When the WGA writer&apos;s strike of 2007 shut down production on TV series, there was talk of a tour for the temporarily unemployed band members. A CD that the band made in 2007, &quot;Hoggin&apos; All The Covers&quot; is available for sale at Amazon.com. In addition, at least one of the band&apos;s songs are on the soundtrack for House M.D. (2004) and two of its songs, &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; and &quot;You Can&apos;t Always Get What You Want&quot;, are available for purchase on iTunes. While on hiatus, between the second and third seasons of Desperate Housewives (2004), Jamie teamed up with Chris Kattan in the straight-to-DVD film, Undead or Alive: A Zombedy (2007). 2007 was a busy year for Denton. In addition to traveling all over the country in order to lend his celebrity to dozens of charitable causes, he also completed three projects - ABC&apos;s Masters of Science Fiction (2007)&apos;s episode, Masters of Science Fiction: The Discarded (2007); Custody (2007), which aired on Lifetime and Tortured (2008). The same year, Denton, a lifelong fan of baseball, joined an Orange County investment group that purchased the Golden Baseball League Team, &quot;The Fullerton Flyers&quot;. Shortly after the purchase and, although the team&apos;s home field remained at Cal State Fullerton, the group changed the name of the team to &quot;The Orange County Flyers&quot;. Not content to merely be an investor, Jamie took as active a role as his schedule and the team structure allowed, attending try-outs, where he had a hand in selecting some of the players during his first season as a co-owner, and attending quite a few of the home games. When &quot;Housewives&quot; isn&apos;t in production, JD still takes part in other productions. These have included Group Sex (2010) and bringing the voice of &quot;Superman&quot; to life in the animated video, All-Star Superman (2011). He played the role of &quot;Slim&quot; in the independent film, Karaoke Man (2012). Jamie announced on the Christopher Gabriel radio program that he and his family were moving to Minnesota in August of 2012 and that he would pursue whatever comes next from there. His fans didn&apos;t have to wait long to hear from him again. In 2013 JD took on the role of Johnny Trey in &quot;Grace Unplugged&quot; and in short order won an award for Outstanding Performance by an Actor. The film won a Top Ten Family Film of the Year and the Grand Prize, &quot;The Epiphany Award&quot; for Most Inspirational Film of 2013. Jamie went on to do the Hallmark Channel&apos;s &quot;Stranded In Paradise&quot;, &quot;Ovation&quot;, &quot;Strangers&quot;, &quot;The Dancer and the Dame&quot; and &quot;Revelation Road 3: The Black Rider&quot;. 2014 found Jamie making a deal with The Hallmark Channel to become (as &quot;Dr. Sam&quot;) part of their original series, &quot;The Good Witch&quot;. His episodes will begin airing in February, 2015. On the home front, a lot of JD&apos;s free time is now spent at Bring It! Studios and Crossfit Channhassen, MN, which is the latest business venture which Jamie and his wife have undertaken.</Description>

<Name>James Naughton</Name>
<Description>James Naughton, a handsome charmer and solid, reliable player on film and TV, is best-known for his magnetic work on the musical stage. The two-time Tony award winner for his cynical, &quot;Sam Spade&quot;-like detective in &quot;City of Angels&quot; (1990) and slick, shyster lawyer/razzle dazzler &quot;Billy Flynn&quot; in the revival of &quot;Chicago&quot; (1997), hails from Yale (School of Drama) and began scoring on Broadway in the 70s with his sharp portrayal as &quot;Edmund&quot; in &quot;Long Day&apos;s Journey Into Night&quot;, and in his Broadway debut with &quot;I Love My Wife&quot;. He has also directed stage plays, such as Arthur Miller&apos;s &quot;The Price&quot; and &quot;Our Town&quot; with Paul Newman and Jane Curtin. A number of TV series throughout the decades failed, however, to light up his name in Hollywood with Making the Grade (1982), Trauma Center (1983) and The Cosby Mysteries (1994), coming and going. The same goes with his steady, restrained work in the films, The Paper Chase (1973), The Glass Menagerie (1987), The Good Mother (1988) and The First Wives Club (1996). Best-known for his trustworthy husbands (well, not always) and well-dressed professionals, he has one of those strong, worldly faces you recognize but can&apos;t place. Recently, Naughton has taken to the cabaret circuit where his simple, relaxed singing style has caught on, especially in his award-winning one-man show &quot;Street of Dreams&quot; which was comprised of a number of eclectic songs from country and western to contemporary pop to classic standards. His children Greg and Keira are also in the business.</Description>

<Name>Jennifer Lawrence</Name>
<Description>Academy Award-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence is best known for playing Katniss Everdeen in The Hunger Games (2012), Tiffany Maxwell in Silver Linings Playbook (2012), and Rosalyn Rosenfeld in American Hustle (2013).Jennifer Shrader Lawrence was born on August 15, 1990 in Louisville, Kentucky, to Karen (Koch), who manages a children&apos;s camp, and Gary Lawrence, who works in construction. She has two older brothers, Ben and Blaine, and has English, German, Irish, and Scottish ancestry.Before Jennifer became an actress, she was involved in cheer-leading, field hockey, softball, and modeling, none of which she held a passion for. Her career began when she traveled to Manhattan at the age of 14. After conducting her first cold read, agents told her mother that &quot;it was the best cold read by a 14- year-old they had ever heard&quot;, and tried to convince her mother that she needed to spend the summer in Manhattan. After leaving the agency, Jen was spotted by an agent in the midst of shooting an H&amp;M ad and asked to take her picture. The next day, that agent followed up with her and invited her to the studio for a cold read audition. Again, the agents were highly impressed and strongly urged her mother to allow her to spend the summer in New York City. As fate would have it, she did, and subsequently appeared in commercials such as MTV&apos;s &quot;My Super Sweet 16&quot; and played a role in the movie, The Devil You Know (2013).Her big break came when she played Ree in Winter&apos;s Bone (2010), which landed her Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations. Shortly thereafter, she secured the role of Mystique in franchise reboot X: First Class (2011), which went on to be a hit in Summer 2011. Around this time, Lawrence scored the role of a lifetime when she was cast as Katniss Everdeen in the big-screen adaptation of literary sensation The Hunger Games (2012). That went on to become one of the highest-grossing movies ever with over $407 million at the domestic box office, and instantly propelled Lawrence to the A-list among young actors/actresses.Three Hunger Games sequels are scheduled for release in November 2013, 2014, and 2015, with Lawrence reprising her role at least for the first one (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013)). In 2012 the romantic comedy Silver Linings Playbook earned her the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Satellite Award and the Independent Spirit Award for Best Actress, amongst other accolades, making her the youngest person ever to be nominated for two Academy Awards for Best Actress and the second-youngest Best Actress winner.Lawrence can also be seen in The Beaver (2011), Like Crazy (2011), House at the End of the Street (2012), and American Hustle (2013). She played the title role, Joy Mangano, in the 2015 David O. Russell film Joy (2015).</Description>

<Name>Johnny Depp</Name>
<Description>Johnny Depp is perhaps one of the most versatile actors of his day and age in Hollywood.He was born John Christopher Depp II in Owensboro, Kentucky, on June 9, 1963, to Betty Sue (Wells), who worked as a waitress, and John Christopher Depp, a civil engineer.Depp was raised in Florida. He dropped out of school when he was 15, and fronted a series of music-garage bands, including one named &apos;The Kids&apos;. However, it was when he married Lori Anne Allison (Lori A. Depp) that he took up the job of being a ballpoint-pen salesman to support himself and his wife. A visit to Los Angeles, California, with his wife, however, happened to be a blessing in disguise, when he met up with actor Nicolas Cage, who advised him to turn to acting, which culminated in Depp&apos;s film debut in the low-budget horror film, A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), where he played a teenager who falls prey to dream-stalking demon Freddy Krueger.In 1987 he shot to stardom when he replaced Jeff Yagher in the role of undercover cop Tommy Hanson in the popular TV series 21 Jump Street (1987).In 1990, after numerous roles in teen-oriented films, his first of a handful of great collaborations with director Tim Burton came about when Depp played the title role in Edward Scissorhands (1990). Following the film&apos;s success, Depp carved a niche for himself as a serious, somewhat dark, idiosyncratic performer, consistently selecting roles that surprised critics and audiences alike. He continued to gain critical acclaim and increasing popularity by appearing in many features before re-joining with Burton in the lead role of Ed Wood (1994). In 1997 he played an undercover FBI agent in the fact-based film Donnie Brasco (1997), opposite Al Pacino; in 1998 he appeared in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (1998), directed by Terry Gilliam; and then, in 1999, he appeared in the sci-fi/horror film The Astronaut&apos;s Wife (1999). The same year he teamed up again with Burton in Sleepy Hollow (1999), brilliantly portraying Ichabod Crane.Depp has played many characters in his career, including another fact-based one, Insp. Fred Abberline in From Hell (2001). He stole the show from screen greats such as Antonio Banderas in the finale to Robert Rodriguez&apos;s &quot;mariachi&quot; trilogy, Once Upon a Time in Mexico (2003). In that same year he starred in the marvelous family blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), playing a character that only the likes of Depp could pull off: the charming, conniving and roguish Capt. Jack Sparrow. The film&apos;s enormous success has opened several doors for his career and included an Oscar nomination. He appeared as the central character in the Stephen King-based movie, Secret Window (2004); as the kind-hearted novelist James Barrie in the factually-based Finding Neverland (2004), where he co-starred with Kate Winslet; and Rochester in the British film, The Libertine (2004). Depp collaborated again with Burton in a screen adaptation of Roald Dahl&apos;s novel, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), and later in Alice in Wonderland (2010) and Dark Shadows (2012).Off-screen, Depp has dated several female celebrities, and has been engaged to Sherilyn Fenn, Jennifer Grey, Winona Ryder and Kate Moss. He was married to Lori Anne Allison in 1983, but divorced her in 1985. Depp has two children with French singer/actress Vanessa Paradis: Lily-Rose Melody, born in 1999 and Jack, born in 2002. He married actress/producer Amber Heard in 2015.</Description>

His career began its measured ascent in 2005 with a supporting slot as one of Will Ferrell&apos;s kids in Kicking &amp; Screaming (2005), a co-starring role in the indie hit Little Manhattan (2005), and another co-starring role in Zathura: A Space Adventure (2005), which was originally conceived as a sequel to Jumanji (1995). Despite underperforming at the box office, &quot;Zathura&quot; helped earned for Josh his first Young Artist Award for &quot;Leading Young Actor&quot;.2006 saw bigger returns for Josh&apos;s burgeoning film career with a role as one of Robin Williams&apos; sons in the modest hit, RV (2006). The following year, he landed his first breakthrough role in Bridge to Terabithia (2007), the kid-approved adaptation of Katherine Paterson&apos;s novel that co-starred AnnaSophia Robb, whose career was also taking off at this time.Josh starred as Brendan Fraser&apos;s nephew in another family-film hit, Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008), and he had a smaller role in the Crash-like drama, Fragments (2008), though by now his face and name were being used in movie-marketing materials. Though it wasn&apos;t a hit, Josh&apos;s character in Cirque du Freak: The Vampire&apos;s Assistant (2009) served as a major plot device early in the story.In 2010, Josh co-starred in the critically-acclaimed film, The Kids Are All Right (2010), alongside Annette Bening, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, and Mia Wasikowska. The film received several awards and four Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture. Josh&apos;s performance as the youngest child in a family, led by two mothers, earned him acclaim from audiences and the industry, alike. Josh followed up with an expanded role in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island (2012), which saw Dwayne Johnson take over as the main character from Brendan Fraser. Between the star power and the allure of 3D, the sequel was a worldwide hit and a third installment is in development.With the announcement that he would portray the beloved &quot;Peeta Mellark&quot; in The Hunger Games (2012), the film adaptation of the best-selling novel written by Suzanne Collins, Josh became an instant celebrity. In the wake of the movie&apos;s massive worldwide success, Detention (2011), a horror/comedy that Josh made before &quot;The Hunger Games&quot;, was released. Josh was also an executive producer on that feature.Before Josh reprises his role as &quot;Peeta&quot; in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), we will see him in the long-delayed remake of Red Dawn (2012); the omnibus 7 d√≠as en La Habana (2012) (aka &quot;7 Days in Havana&quot;) (Josh&apos;s segment was directed by Benicio Del Toro); The Forger (2012) opposite Lauren Bacall, Alfred Molina, and Hayden Panettiere; and the animated Epic (2013) from Ice Age (2002) co-director (and voice of &quot;Scrat&quot;), Chris Wedge.</Description>

Katie had just been accepted to &apos;Tisch&apos; at NYU when she was offered her first role as &quot;Dee Dee&quot;, which was one month before graduating. Katie has not stopped working since.

<Name>Lee Arenberg</Name>
<Description>Lee Arenberg has the remarkable ability to morph himself into frightening aliens, twisted psychotherapists, lascivious entertainment executives and everything in between. Most frequently referred to as a character actor, Arenberg maintains a flourishing acting career--almost 20 years spanning television, stage and film. Arenberg has appeared in more than 30 movies, including Cradle Will Rock (1999), RoboCop 3 (1993), Waterworld (1995), Bob Roberts (1992), The Apocalypse (1997), Cross My Heart (1987) and the fantasy adventure feature Dungeons &amp; Dragons (2000). Bitten by the acting bug at age eight when he portrayed David in his Hebrew school play, &quot;Killing Goliath&quot;, Arenberg notes that the parable &quot;could be the title of any actor&apos;s chances in this game.&quot; A native Angeleno, Lee attended Santa Monica high school with &quot;brat packers&quot; Sean Penn, Robert Downey Jr. and Emilio Estevez, and co-wrote a play with Estevez which was directed by Penn. Lee&apos;s first professional job was in 1986 at the Mark Taper Forum in &quot;Ghetto&quot;, a play directed by Gordon Davidson. Within weeks he was cast in three films, including the role of Norton in the feature Tapeheads (1988)opposite Tim Robbins and John Cusack. Guest appearances on television began in 1987 with the hit sitcom Perfect Strangers (1986), and have continued with memorable roles such as the parking space-stealing New Yorker on Seinfeld (1989) and as the murderous rock promoter opposite Katey Sagal and Sam Kinison in Tales from the Crypt (1989), as well as roles on Arli$$ (1996), Friends (1994), Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987), Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (1993) and Star Trek: Voyager (1995). Arenberg can also be seen in the role of the notoriously huge studio head, Bobby G., on the controversial syndicated comedy Action (1999) opposite series star Jay Mohr. Arenberg names his family and friends as his inspirations, and states that having grown up on Los Angeles&apos; Westside, he was able to see actors as the parents of friends and classmates, not as just as movie stars. &quot;It also gave me an honest assessment of the industry and what I was getting myself into,&quot; he laughs. He credits &quot;fear of failure&quot; as his main motivation, and admires the talents and creativity of such legendary actors Paul Muni, Lon Chaney and Boris Karloff. Lee also credits much of his development as an actor to his participation in the Actors&apos; Gang, one of Los Angeles&apos; oldest theater companies. The Actors&apos; Gang was founded by Lee in 1981 with Tim Robbins and other friends from UCLA. After 20 years as an actor in the group, Lee recently made his writing and directing debut with Foursome, a play about golf, sex and witchcraft. In his leisure time, Arenberg enjoys golf, cooking, blues harmonica, video games and pitching for his softball team Bubblin&apos; Crude, which is made up of other actors, many of whom are friends from high school. He is involved with St. Jude&apos;s Children&apos;s Hospital and other children&apos;s health causes, and animal rights organizations, participating regularly in fund raising efforts on behalf of those charitable causes.</Description>

Though the tumor was benign, the resulting surgery led to a period of partial facial paralysis, from which he fully recovered. In 2003, Ruffalo scored leading roles alongside two popular female stars, playing a police detective opposite Meg Ryan in In the Cut (2003) and the love interest of Gwyneth Paltrow in the comedy View from the Top (2003). Though both films were high-profile box office disappointments, Ruffalo went on to four notable (if highly disparate) films in 2004 - We Don&apos;t Live Here Anymore (2004), Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004), 13 Going on 30 (2004), and Collateral (2004) - which solidified his ability to be both a popular leading man and an acclaimed ensemble player in either comedy or drama.After 2004, Ruffalo was consistently at work, with leads in popular Hollywood films and independent productions that continued to solidify him as one of film&apos;s most consistently strong actors: Just Like Heaven (2005), All the King&apos;s Men (2006), Zodiac (2007), Reservation Road (2007), and The Brothers Bloom (2008). In 2010 Ruffalo achieved something of a breakthrough, by directing the indie film Sympathy for Delicious (2010), which won him the Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and co-starring as the sperm-donor father to lesbian couple Annette Bening and Julianne Moore in The Kids Are All Right (2010).

<Name>Patrick Dempsey</Name>
<Description>He made his movie debut in the secondary part of a Catholic student in the 1960s-era school-age comedy Heaven Help Us (1985) starring &quot;Brat Pack&quot; actor Andrew McCarthy. More silliness followed with Meatballs III: Summer Job (1986) and a ripe turn in the socially aware television-movie Disneyland: A Fighting Choice (1986) in which he played an epileptic teen who sues his parents (Beau Bridges and Karen Valentine) in order to have risky brain surgery. Around the same time, he found himself in a television series entitled Fast Times (1986), based on the ultimate school-age film Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), which made a star out of Sean Penn. Inheriting the Robert Romanus cool guy role of con artist Mike Damone, expectations were far too big and the television series died a quick death.However, his movie career got on a faster track and he scored well co-starring with the worldly Beverly D&apos;Angelo in the movie In the Mood (1987), as a young man who makes headlines pursuing older women. Life resembled art that same year when Patrick married actress and drama coach Rocky Parker, who played a bit part in the film. He was 21 and she was 48. By this time, his trademark cuteness and appeal started taking shape. The youthful 21-year old Patrick played a nerd role next in the very funny high school comedy Can&apos;t Buy Me Love (1987) with Amanda Peterson. A movie favorite for many, Patrick had reached the peak of his early career popularity. He showed a more serious side in the World War II-era drama In a Shallow Grave (1988), which presented a Cyrano de Bergerac-like storyline with Patrick as the Christian de Neuvillette counterpart, but then he went straight back to familiar territory with the college-themed comedies Some Girls (1988) with Jennifer Connelly, Loverboy (1989), and Happy Together (1989).Stretching more in the 1990s, Patrick co-starred on stage in a 1991 production of &quot;The Subject Was Roses&quot; (playing the Martin Sheen film role) as the World War II soldier readjusting to civilian life with his parents (Dana Ivey and &quot;Frasier&quot; co-star John Mahoney). Films included the cross-country comedy-drama Coupe de Ville (1990), the action thriller Run (1991), Mobsters (1991), in which he made a stab at playing major Mafioso Meyer Lansky, Face the Music (1993) opposite &quot;Brat Pack&quot; femme Molly Ringwald, the title role in Bank Robber (1993), and the Mark Twain family-geared Ava&apos;s Magical Adventure (1998), co-directed by Patrick and wife Rocky. However, the couple divorced that same year. On television, Patrick played a young John Fitzgerald Kennedy in the miniseries J.F.K.: Reckless Youth (1993), Pierre Arronax in the television remake of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1997), and Raskolnikov in a small screen version of Crime and Punishment (1998). The rest of the decade on film was less newsworthy with co-starring or featured movie roles in Hugo Pool (1997), Denial (1998), There&apos;s No Fish Food in Heaven (1998) and Me and Will (1999).It was television that gave Patrick a shot in the arm as he progressed into the new millennium. A recurring role as Will&apos;s closeted sportscaster amour in the sitcom Will &amp; Grace (1998) presented Patrick in a more mature, wry and sexier fashion. Another recurring role in Once and Again (1999) earned him a dramatic Emmy nomination in 2001 as Outstanding Guest Actor, and a third on The Practice (1997) was also extremely well-received. While the romantic comedy film Sweet Home Alabama (2002) opposite Reese Witherspoon really nailed the direction Dempsey was headed, the medical series Grey&apos;s Anatomy (2005), as neurosurgeon Dr. Derek Shepherd (aka &quot;Dr. McDreamy&quot;), gave distaff audiences the whole heartthrob package. The perfect vehicle to showcase his undeniable charisma and sharp talent for offbeat comedy, he is a two-time Golden Globe nominee and his popularity has absolutely skyrocketed. This reawakening has also swung the door open again on high-profile film offers, registering with the ladies once again in a number of light leading man parts, notably Enchanted (2007) and Made of Honor (2008).</Description>

<Name>Scott Michael Foster</Name>
<Description>Born in Illinois and raised in the Dallas-Fort Worth area of Texas, Foster knew from an early age that he wanted to be an actor. He grew up just outside of Chicago until he was 12 years old, where his family lived on a farm and he was home schooled. When Foster&apos;s older sisters started to dabble in theatre he immediately became interested in the entertainment industry. Soon after moving to Dallas with his family he chose theatre as an elective in middle school, pursued the arts in high school, and went on to study at the Quad C Theatre Program at Collin County Community College. In 2004 Foster decided to make the big move to Los Angeles. Once in LA, Foster joined an acting class, met his manager, and started booking commercials. In 2005 he landed several independent films, and in 2007 he booked what would become his regular acting gig for the next five years: a series regular role starring as &quot;Cappie&quot; on the hit series &quot;Greek&quot; for ABC Family. While putting in time on &quot;Greek&quot; Foster wrote, produced, and starred in his own script that he sold to Comedy Central entitled &quot;Neighbros.&quot; The show sold in the fall of 2010 for fall&apos;s 2011 pilot season. Although the experience of putting together a show was something Foster loved, he decided to put all side projects on hold and focus on booking new acting roles. By the time &quot;Greek&quot; had ended its run in 2011 Foster had made his mark at ABC through his work on the show, and his relationship with the network would continue to grow over the next several years. Foster went on to score a handful of guest star roles including appearances on: TNT&apos;s &quot;The Closer,&quot; NBC&apos;s &quot;Friends with Benefits,&quot; &quot;Law and Order: LA,&quot; and &quot;Parenthood,&quot; and ABC Family&apos;s &quot;Melissa &amp; Joey.&quot; He also held a recurring role on &quot;Quarterlife&quot; for NBC and starred in the 2009 fan favorite independent feature TEENAGE DIRTBAG. In 2012 Foster had the opportunity to play characters that were far from the happy go lucky teen he portrayed on &quot;Greek.&quot; First, he was seen in 10 episodes of the hit Showtime series &quot;Californication&quot; starring opposite David Duchovny as &quot;Tyler,&quot; and went on to play &quot;Jonas Beckett&quot; in five episodes of ABC&apos;s Emmy Nominated series &quot;The River.&quot; Soon after filming &quot;The River,&quot; ABC enlisted Foster once again, casting him in &quot;Zero Hour&quot; [2013] opposite Anthony Edwards, Jacinda Barrett, Addison Timlin, and Carmen Ejogo. When not acting Foster is an active supporter of The Sue Weaver Cause, an organization that promotes consumer awareness of unsafe service employment - their quest is to require proper annual criminal background checks on all workers sent to people&apos;s homes. Foster is also a musician, making music for over nine years and released an EP in 2009 with his band Siren&apos;s Eye. He recently became a certified scuba diver, and currently lives in the Los Angeles area with his two dogs, Oliver and Charlie.</Description>
